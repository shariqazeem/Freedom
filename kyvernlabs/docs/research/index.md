# Research Publications

Kyvern Labs conducts peer-reviewed security research focused on protecting autonomous AI agents in decentralized systems.

## Featured Papers

### Indirect Prompt Injection Defense

**SANDBOX_TRIGGER Mechanism for Source Detection**

A novel approach to detecting malicious instructions embedded in external data sources. Our sandbox trigger mechanism allows agents to safely process untrusted content by identifying when that content attempts to override agent behavior.
