## 1. Critique: "Nexus Agents"

### The Honest Assessment

| Dimension | Score | Analysis |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Institutional Weight | 4/10 | "Nexus" is overused. "Agents" sounds like recruiters or realtors. |
| Technical Credibility | 5/10 | "Agents" is now generic (every AI company uses it). No differentiation. |
| IPO Readiness | 3/10 | Cannot picture this on NASDAQ ticker. Sounds like a Discord mod team. |
| Domain Viability | 6/10 | NexusAgents.com likely available, but forgettable. |
| VC Pattern Match | 4/10 | Doesn't trigger "this is infrastructure" pattern that VCs love. |

### Why It Fails the "Billboard Test"

Imagine this on a Bloomberg Terminal or a TechCrunch headline:

> *"Nexus Agents Raises $50M Series B for Web3 Security Infrastructure"*

It reads like a staffing company pivoted to crypto. The word "Agents" has been diluted by:
- Real estate (Keller Williams agents)
- Customer service (support agents)
- Generic AI (LangChain agents, AutoGPT agents)

**The Core Problem:** It describes *what you build* (agents), not *what you represent* (protection, intelligence, infrastructure).

### What "Nexus Agents" Gets Right
- Short (2 words)
- .com likely available
- "Nexus" implies connectivity (good for Web3)

**Verdict:** Fine for a side project. Not for a company you want to sell for $100M+.

- Perfect for "high-speed AI tools" positioning
- Clean ticker: VCTR

## 6. What to Do Next

1. **Check domain availability** on Namecheap/GoDaddy for top 3 picks
2. **Search USPTO** for trademark conflicts
3. **Search Twitter/X** for handle availability (@vectordynamics, @stratum_labs, etc.)
4. **Test with 5 people:** "I'm starting a company called [X] that builds AI security for crypto communities." Watch their face.

The right name should make people lean in and ask: *"Tell me more."*
